## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:

    
    git clone https://github.com/NehaTummala/-Healthcare-ML-Analytics-Platform
    

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    
    cd Healthcare-ML-Analytics-Platform
    

3.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

    
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    

4.  Install the required dependencies (if any):

    
    pip install -r requirements.txt #Create this requirments.txt file with all the libarires you used
    

5.  Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Usage

*   Refer to ckd_project_overview.ipynb for a project introduction.
*   Explore the data and analysis steps in the other notebooks.
*   Modify and adapt the code for your own research or applications.

## Ethical Considerations
